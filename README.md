**Abstract:**

The discovery of chemical reactions is an inherently unpredictable
and time-consuming process. An attractive alternative is to predict
reactivity, although relevant approaches, such as computer-aided
reaction design, are still in their infancy. Reaction prediction
based on high-level quantum chemical methods is complex, even
for simple molecules. In addition, although machine learning
is powerful for data analysis, its applications in chemistry are
still being developed. Inspired by strategies based on chemists’
intuition, we propose that a reaction system controlled by a
machine learning algorithm may be able to explore the space of
chemical reactions quickly, especially if trained by an expert. Here
we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical
reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually,
as well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations
after conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively
navigating chemical reaction space. By using machine learning
for decision making, enabled by binary encoding of the chemical
inputs, the reactions can be assessed in real time using nuclear
magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The machine
learning system was able to predict the reactivity of about 1,000
reaction combinations with accuracy greater than 80 per cent after
considering the outcomes of slightly over 10 per cent of the dataset.
This approach was also used to calculate the reactivity of published
datasets. Further, by using real-time data from our robot, these
predictions were followed up manually by a chemist, leading to the
discovery of four reactions.
